This notebook is intended to show how different classification models can be compared by using different numerical metrics.
The data provided was taken out from some surveys that were performed in a classroom. 
The objective of this was to predict if the person has a cat or a dog by analyzing variables such as weigth, type of ears, whiskers length, etc.
Hope you enjoy it :)
